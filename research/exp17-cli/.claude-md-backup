## Code Navigation

This project uses fmm (Frontmatter Matters) for structured code navigation.

### FMM Headers — Read These First

Source files have `// --- FMM ---` comment blocks at the top. These are **machine-generated structural metadata** — not comments to skip. They describe a file's exports, imports, dependencies, and LOC.

**ALWAYS read the first 15 lines of a file before reading the full source.** The FMM header tells you what the file does without reading the implementation.

### MCP Tools

When the fmm MCP server is available:
- `fmm_lookup_export(name)` — O(1) symbol → file lookup. Use before Grep.
- `fmm_dependency_graph(file)` — upstream deps + downstream dependents (blast radius)
- `fmm_search({export?, imports?, depends_on?, min_loc?, max_loc?})` — find files by structural criteria
- `fmm_list_exports(pattern?, file?)` — search exports by substring
- `fmm_file_info(file)` — file metadata from the index

### Manifest
- `.fmm/index.json` contains the pre-indexed metadata for all source files
- `exportIndex` maps every export name → file path

### CLI Fallback
```bash
fmm search --export <name>    # Find file by export
fmm search --imports <module> # Find files importing module
fmm search --depends-on ./auth # Impact analysis
```
